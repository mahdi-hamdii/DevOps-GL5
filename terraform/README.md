# Managed Kubernetes Cluster

> Managed Kubernetes is when third-party providers take over responsibility for some or all of the work necessary for the successful set-up and operation of K8s. Depending on the vendor, “managed” can refer to anything from dedicated support, to hosting with pre-configured environments, to full hosting and operation.

--------
In AKS, we will be using the managed kubernetes solution proposed by Azure.

# Unmanaged Kubernetes

> ‘unmanaged Kubernetes’ refers to the fact that you have to deal with the installation and maintenance of Kubernetes yourself – essentially, you have to manage Kubernetes on your own. Primarily, this will be necessary if a hosting with a cloud provider is not possible or not wanted.

--------
In Kubeadm, we will be provisionning Virtual Machines on Azure and seting up our own K8s cluster
